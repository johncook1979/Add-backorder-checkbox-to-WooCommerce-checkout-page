# Add backorder checkbox to WooCommerce checkout page 
Add backorder checkbox to WooCommerce checkout page and save checkbox value to customers order. Use this to notify shoppers and get then to acknowledge items are not currently in your store.This can save several headaches.
Original concept from my blog [Add backorder checkbox to WooCommerce checkout page](https://wcsuccessacademy.com/add-backorder-acceptance-checkbox-to-woocommerce-checkout-page-and-save-acceptance-and-order-with-backorder-to-customers-order/ "WC Success Academy")
